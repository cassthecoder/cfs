      <p>My name is Cassandra Matos, but you can call me Cass. I am a Longhorn Alumn (University of Texas at Austin) with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. Currently I work as a freelance full stack developer, as well as a graphic designer and photographer. I am always looking for new opportunities to work with individuals or small companies whom share a passion with “outside of the box” ideas. I appreciate the arts to an unbound degree and strive to help brand these passions by creating an artistic and efficient online presence. </p>

        <h1>My Background</h1>
      </header>
      <p>As you read above, I went to college at the University of Texas at Austin where I recieved a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. My specialized areas were Digital Signal Processing and Hardware Design, although I just consider myself a math nerd so I took a lot of classes on all the math I could get my hands on. After college, I jumped around in the professional world and gained a strong background in sales, customer support, and hustling :)</p>

        <h1>Why I Decided to Learn Programming</h1>
      </header>
      <p>I had originally learned programming at UT in my engineering courses but it never really clicked, except for Assembly Language (I love binary!). It was not until I was working for GoDaddy that I found myself selling websites that I considered cookie cutter that I decided that I should design and make websites myself. So I jumped into the coding world and taught myself how to make things the way I like it. Now I am just looking for more opportunities to expand my coding horizon.</p>
